# What is it?
This is a guide for maximising your chances of survival in case of **natural disaster**.  
But really, I highly recomand checking other sources in case you really end up in a natural disaster situation.  
# Why?
Because why not. Some people might actually find this helpful.
# Want to contribute?
Just create an issue, pull request or something.
Contributions are welcome, especially on lost repos that no one ever saw like this one.
